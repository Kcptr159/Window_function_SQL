# Window_function_SQL


A window function, also known as a windowing function or windowing operator, is a concept in the field of data analysis, particularly in SQL and signal processing. It is used to perform calculations over a specified "window" or subset of rows within a larger set of data, allowing for more advanced and flexible data manipulation and analysis.

In the context of SQL, window functions are typically used in conjunction with the OVER clause to define the window of rows for which a calculation is performed. The window is defined based on certain criteria, such as ordering of rows and partitioning of data into groups. Common window functions include:

Ranking Functions: These functions assign a rank or position to each row within the defined window. Examples include ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and NTILE().

Aggregate Functions: Unlike traditional aggregate functions that collapse a set of rows into a single value, windowed aggregate functions compute an aggregate value for each row within the window. Examples include SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().

Analytic Functions: These functions compute analytical results for each row in the window. Examples include calculating running totals, differences, ratios, and moving averages.

Lead and Lag Functions: These functions allow you to access data from other rows within the same window. LEAD() retrieves data from the following row, while LAG() retrieves data from the previous row.

Percentile Functions: Functions like PERCENTILE_CONT() and PERCENTILE_DISC() calculate percentiles for data within the window.

Window functions are particularly useful for tasks such as ranking, aggregating data with context, and performing complex calculations that require information from neighboring rows.
